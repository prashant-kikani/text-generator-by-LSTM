# text-generator-by-LSTM
It predicts next word and generate the whole play in shakespeare style given the seed sequence. <br/>
Simple LSTM of 128 units is used with one Dense layer. <br/>
You can cut the dataset to half if your laptop or PC run out of memory while creating the train data for neural network. <br/>
Minimimum 20 to 25 epoch is required to generate a human like play. Which requires a great amount of time and computantional power (many GPUs)<br/>
<br/>
You can feed any dataset to it. It will learn from it. And will generate further.
